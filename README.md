This is a Windows Universal App which teaches a user to **learn to write a new language with scribbling**.<br />
In other words, a user can select any particular language he/she wants to learn to write and click start.<br />
The app uses simpleInkPen API (Microsoft) to detect the pattern.<br />
A sequence of alphabets/symbols/letters of that language will appear on the screen which the user will have to draw on the canvas with touch or mouse drag.<br />
If the drawn pattern is correct on the canvas, 1 point will be given to the user and next set of symbols will appear.<br />
<br />
Note:- The app teaches to write in a new language, prerequisite the user should know how to speak in that language.<br /><br />
This app can be highly extended by adding a lot of features such that adding voice along with the letters, showing images corresponding to the word, different levels for letters, words, sentences, grammars etc., making it more interactive by making it a multiplayer game.<br />
Please contribute to this to make it a usable user-friendly app.
